    "#### An F-test is any statistical test in which the test statistic has an F-distribution under the null hypothesis. It is most often used when comparing statistical models that have been fitted to a data set, in order to identify the model that best fits the population from which the data were sampled. Exact \"F-tests\" mainly arise when the models have been fitted to the data using least squares. The name was coined by George W. Snedecor, in honour of Sir Ronald A. Fisher. Fisher initially developed the statistic as the variance ratio in the 1920s\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The hypothesis that the means of a given set of normally distributed populations, all having the same standard deviation, are equal. This is perhaps the best-known F-test, and plays an important role in the analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n",
    "#### The hypothesis that a proposed regression model fits the data well. See Lack-of-fit sum of squares.\n",
    "#### The hypothesis that a data set in a regression analysis follows the simpler of two proposed linear models that are nested within each other.\n",
    "#### In addition, some statistical procedures, such as Scheffé's method for multiple comparisons adjustment in linear models, also use F-tests."

All such tests are usually called Student's t-tests, though strictly speaking that name should only be used if the variances of the two populations are also assumed to be equal; the form of the test used when this assumption is dropped is sometimes called Welch's t-test. These tests are often referred to as \"unpaired\" or \"independent samples\" t-tests, as they are typically applied when the statistical units underlying the two samples being compared are non-overlapping.\n",

For example, suppose we measure the size of a cancer patient's tumor before and after a treatment. If the treatment is effective, we expect the tumor size for many of the patients to be smaller following the treatment. This is often referred to as the \"paired\" or \"repeated measures\" t-test: see paired difference test.\n",
